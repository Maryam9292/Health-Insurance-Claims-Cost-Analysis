# Health-Insurance-Claims-Cost-Analysis
This project analyzes medical insurance claim costs using machine learning to predict expenses, profile high-risk claimants, and identify key cost drivers. The insights are visualized in an interactive Power BI dashboard for business intelligence. Designed for insurers, actuaries, and healthcare analysts.

## Key Features  
- üß† **Predictive Modeling**: 5 regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to forecast claim costs  
- üìä **Power BI Dashboard**: Interactive visualizations of high-risk profiles and cost drivers
- üîç **High-Risk Profiling**: Identifies claimants with top 20% expenses using synthetic pre-existing conditions  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Feature Engineering**:  
  - BMI categories (Underweight/Healthy/Overweight/Obese)  
  - Age groups (18-30, 31-45, 46-60, 60+)  
  - High-risk flag (smoker + BMI ‚â•30 + pre-existing condition)

**Interactive Features:**
- Drill-down regional analysis
- Dynamic risk profiling filters
- Year-over-year cost trend projections
- Claimant demographic segmentation

**Power BI Analysis Findings:**
- Smokers incur 3.8x higher costs than non-smokers
- Obese claimants represent 68% of high-cost cases
- Southwest region has 22% more high-risk claimants
- 60+ age group accounts for 41% of top-cost claims
