This project analyzes medical insurance claim costs using machine learning to predict expenses, profile high-risk claimants, and identify key cost drivers. Designed for insurers, actuaries, and healthcare analysts.

## Key Features  
- üß† **Predictive Modeling**: 5 regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to forecast claim costs.  
- üîç **High-Risk Profiling**: Identifies claimants with top 20% expenses using synthetic pre-existing conditions.  
- üìä **Feature Engineering**:  
  - BMI categories (Underweight/Healthy/Overweight/Obese)  
  - Age groups (18-30, 31-45, 46-60, 60+)  
  - High-risk flag (smoker + BMI ‚â•30 + pre-existing condition)  
- üìà **Visual Analytics**: Correlation heatmaps, feature importance plots, and distribution graphs.  

## Results  
| Model                  | R¬≤ Score | 
|------------------------|----------|
| Gradient Boosting      | 0.88     | 
| Random Forest          | 0.87     |  
| Ridge Regression       | 0.85     |  
| **Top Test Performance** |          |
| R¬≤                     | 0.87     |
| MAE                    | $2,450   |  
| RMSE                   | $6,980   |  

**Key Cost Drivers**:  
1. Smoking status  
2. BMI  
3. Age  
4. Pre-existing conditions
